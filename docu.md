**III. DESCRIPTION OF THE FLOW DIAGRAM OF THE INSTALLATION**

**(by example of a single unit of** **zeolite gas desulfurization****)**

Natural gas purification (stripping) from hydrogen sulfide and dehydration are produced by absorption method, based on selective extraction of above impurities by solid sorbents-adsorbents. Synthetic zeolites of type СаА (5А) are used as adsorbents at the installation.

One unit of zeolite desulphurization installation consists of eight concurrent adsorbers. At the same time on adsorption there are six concurrent adsorbers, one adsorber is on regeneration, one - on cooling. To be purified from hydrogen sulphide and moisture, natural gas enters the zeolite installation (unit) after installation of low-temperature gas separation. Each adsorber is equipped with 5-input and output ball valves Du 200 Ru80 to control technological processes (adsorption, regeneration and cooling).

In the unit, gas comes in two concurrent input separators E-1/1, E-1/2. After separation of dropping liquid, combined gas flow is served in six concurrent adsorbers in adsorption mode from the top down. Purified and dehumidified  gas from adsorbers enters the filter- dust collector F-1/1,  F-1/2, designed for gas purification from small particles of adsorbent. After filtering, dry purified gas goes from interdepartmental collectors of commercial gas for further deep processing to installations of propane-butane mixture production.

Cooling and regeneration of adsorbent is made by purified gas, extracted from compressed commercial gas after installation of propane-butane mixture preparation or exit from the shop of zeolite desulfurization. Supply of cooling and regeneration gas is carried out by backflow to main flow of purified gas.

Dry purified gas, intended for regeneration, at the beginning of the cycle is served in cooled adsorber; gas, heated during heat transfer process, in the adsorber passes consistently along tube side of waste heat exchangers T-1/1.2 and served in furnace coil P-1. Heated in the furnace coils gas flows into the regeneration gas collector and is sent to the adsorber to be regenerated. After going through the adsorber, gas is saturated with hydrogen sulphide, water vapor, and is served in shell side of heat exchangers T-1/1.2. Regeneration gas is cooled in air cooling units and served in amine desulfurization installations of  the 1,2-stage for further purification.

Switching of adsorbers modes "adsorption-regeneration-cooling" is carried out with opening and/or closing of the appropriate ball valve, installed on the incoming and outgoing pipes of adsorber.

Process flow diagram of the unit is attached (annex №3)
